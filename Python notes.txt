Python notes

ints, floats
int division uses flooring
use // to force floor division for floats
others float division is normal
using combination of floats, ints: result will be a float
last expression assign to variable '_'

Strings
escape special characters
if using ', need to escape other ' in string, escape for " not needed
other way around for double quotes as well.
use raw string to interpret as string literal, no escapes
print r'hello\n'
multi line:  """..."""
prevent new line by adding \ at end of line
concatenate with +, repeate with *
with string literals, can add like 'py' 'thon'
to get a character like so: word[1]
to go reverse, word[-1]
slicing: (substring)
word[0:2]  -> 'Py'
if either is omitted, default to 0 and length of string
String are immutable
string length: len(s)

printing strings:
separate things printed with a ',' and a space automatically added
new line added after each print statement
add trailing comma to avoid new line after output

function example:
>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         print a,
...         a, b = b, a+b

function names can be set like variables
f = fib  #can now call function using f(n)

method: member function
function: non-member function
